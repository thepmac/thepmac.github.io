			Patrick and Rebecca have really wanted to share <em>not interesting</em> things with their friends, but they couldnâ€™t figure out the best way. It <s>yawned</s> dawned upon them one summer afternoon that they had the internet at their finger-tips. So, they decided to make a website, their own platform, to keep their friends <em>not interested</em>.

			If youâ€™re reading this, it means you are The Chosen. ðŸ–¤ Thanks for coming! It also must mean you have been enjoying your time too much and really need something <em>not interesting</em>. Youâ€™ve come to the right place. At the beginning of each month, weâ€™ll share a selection of things that have really <em>not interested</em> us. We hope it wonâ€™t add any value to your life and that youâ€™ll leave feeling like you wasted your time and question how much longer you want to be our friends.

		<h2>Hypertext</h2>
		<br>
		<p>
			See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transclusion" target="_blank">Transclusion</a> (wiki). "In computer science, transclusion is the inclusion of part or all of an electronic document into one or more other documents by hypertext reference. Transclusion is usually performed when the referencing document is displayed, and is normally automatic and transparent to the end user. The result of transclusion is a single integrated document made of parts assembled dynamically from separate sources, possibly stored on different computers in disparate places.<br><br>
			Transclusion facilitates modular design: a resource is stored once and distributed for reuse in multiple documents. Updates or corrections to a resource are then reflected in any referencing documents. Ted Nelson coined the term for his 1980 nonlinear book Literary Machines, but the idea of master copy and occurrences was applied 17 years before, in Sketchpad.""

			The hypertext allows for non-linear connections between documents, ideas, words, or pieces.
		</p>
		<p>
			The hypertext allows for more associative connections. A set of documents doesn't have to be linearly categorized (e.g alphabetical order). It doesn't have to have reasonable connections or groupings either (e.g. categorical groupings). If you want to connect a document on pineapples to a document on utility poles, you can do that. If it makes sense in the context of your larger work, hypertext allows for these kinds of associative links.
		</p>
		<p>
			Hypertext, unlike paper documents, does not force a singular sequence. Because of the physical structure of paper, it enforces a particular kind of order. Hypertext is flexible and allows for varieties of orders and structures and connections.
		</p>
		<p>
			Marginal notes, side notes, footnotes, metadata, parallel documents, etc. are all examples of documents or data that can be linked within hypertext documents in varieties of ways that do not depend on linear, single-stream orderings.
		</p>
		<p>
			Hypertext can allow for one document to connect to many others. It can allow for one document to bring you do a group of documents that each connect to other groups. Like a spider web or fractal.
		<p>
			History is a set of many events that sometimes coincide with one another. The nature of hypertext allows for documents that may be more suitable to recording history.

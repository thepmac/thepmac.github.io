	<h1>The First Post</h1><br>
	<p>This is the first post, of course. I began this site to see where it might go. I began this site to see what I could get away with. I begain this site to see what I am capable of. I begain this site to record the things I think about. I began this site because, maybe, I can influence things.</p>
	<p>There is a poem in front of me. I cannot read it. It is in a language that only children understand.</p>

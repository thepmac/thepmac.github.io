			<p id="about-copy">Welcome to my home, my neighborhood, my city. This is my online living space. This is where I keep my online things and where I keep things online.</p>
			<p id="about-copy">This place changes over time (I change over time too!). The "Log" keeps track of any changes and new constructions. <span style="font-style:italic;">Maybe even demolitions in the future...</span></p>
			<p id="about-copy">Right now, there isn't much. Right now I'm still moving in and unpacking. But please come visit once in a while and look around! Maybe you'll find some interesting things later on. Everything is here for sharing.</p>

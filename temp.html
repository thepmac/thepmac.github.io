        <div class="section">“Your name’s not on the passenger list,” said Craig when I walked into the waiting room of the Patuxent airport. “You’d better see what you can do about it.” It was a hot spring night and I had just flown down from Washington, expecting to board
            a transatlantic plane which was scheduled to take off at midnight. “There must be some mistake,” I said. “I checked on that just before I left Washington.” Craig went with me to the counter where I asked the pretty WAVE on duty to look up
            my name. It wasn’t on her list. “Let’s see what they know about this at the main office,” she said with an encouraging smile as she dialed Naval Air Transport in Washington. The next ten minutes were grim. The officer at the other end of the
            line wanted to know with whom I had checked. Had it been someone in his office? I didn’t know. All I knew was that I had to get on that plane. I had important papers which had to be delivered to our Paris office without delay. Was I a courier?
            Yes, I was—well, that is, almost, I faltered to the WAVE ensign who had been transmitting my replies. “Here, you talk to him,” she said, adding, as she handed me the receiver, “I think he can fix it up.” After going through the same questions
            and getting the same answers a second time, the officer in Washington asked to speak to the yeoman who was supervising the loading of the plane. He was called in and I waited on tenterhooks until I heard him say, “Yes, sir, I can make room
            for the lieutenant and his gear.” Turning the phone over to the WAVE, he asked with a reassuring grin, “Feel better, Lieutenant?” I was so limp with relief that I scarcely noticed the tall spare man in civilian clothes who had just come up
            to the counter. “That’s Lindbergh,” said Craig in a low voice. “Do you suppose he’s going over too?” Half an hour later we trooped out across the faintly lighted field to the C-54 which stood waiting. Lindbergh, dressed now in the olive-drab
            uniform of a Naval Technician, preceded us up the steps. There were ten of us in all. With the exception of three leather-cushioned chairs, there were only bucket seats. Craig and I settled ourselves in two of these uninviting hollows and
            began fumbling clumsily with the seat belts. Seeing that we were having trouble, Lindbergh came over and with a friendly smile asked if he could give us a hand. After deftly adjusting our belts, he returned to one of the cushioned seats across
            the way. Doors slammed, the engines began to roar and, a few seconds later, we were off. We mounted swiftly into the star-filled sky and, peering out, watched the dark Maryland hills drop away. We dozed despite the discomfort of our bent-over
            positions and didn’t come to again until the steward roused us several hours later with coffee and sandwiches. Afterward he brought out army cots and motioned to us to set them up if we wanted to stretch out. As soon as we got the cots unfolded
            and the pegs set in place, he turned out the lights. Craig was dead to the world in a few minutes but I couldn’t get back to sleep. To the accompaniment of the humming motors, the events of the past weeks began to pass in review: that quiet
            April afternoon at Western Sea Frontier Headquarters in San Francisco when my overseas orders had come through—those orders I had been waiting for so long, more than a year. It was in March of 1944 that I first learned there was a chance of
            getting a European assignment, to join the group of officers working with our armies in the “protection and salvaging of artistic monuments in war areas.” That was the cumbersome way it was described. The President had appointed a commission
            with a long name, but it came to be known simply as the Roberts Commission. Justice Roberts of the Supreme Court was the head of it. It was the first time in history that a country had taken such precautions to safeguard cultural monuments
            lying in the paths of its invading armies. It was the commission’s job to recommend to the War Department servicemen whose professional qualifications fitted them for this work. I had been in the Navy for two years. Before that I had been
            director of the California Palace of the Legion of Honor, one of San Francisco’s two municipal museums of the fine arts. The commission had recommended me, but it was up to me to obtain my own release. I had been in luck on that score. My
            commanding officer had agreed to let me go. And more important, my wife had too. Only Francesca had wanted to know why Americans should be meddling with Europe’s art treasures. Weren’t there enough museum directors over there to take care
            of things? Of course there were in normal times. But now they needed men in uniform—to go in with the armies. And after all that planning nothing had happened, until three weeks ago. Then everything had happened at once. The orders directed
            me to report to SHAEF for duty with the Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives Section, G-5, and additional duty with the Allied Control Council for Germany. The papers had been full of stories about German salt mines—the big one at Merkers where
            our troops had found the Nazi gold and the treasures from the Berlin museums. I was going to Germany. Would I find anything like that? I had flown to Washington to receive last-minute instructions. I was to make the trip across by air and
            was given an extra allowance of twenty-five pounds to enable me to take along a dozen Baedekers and a quantity of photographic paper for distribution among our officers in the field. I had been introduced to Craig Smyth while in the midst
            of these final preparations. Like me, he was a naval lieutenant and his orders were identical with mine. He was a grave young Princetonian, formerly on the staff of the National Gallery of Art in Washington. It was raining when we reached
            Stevensville, Newfoundland, early the next morning. After an hour’s stop we were on our way again. Shortly before noon we struck good weather and all day long sea and sky remained unvaryingly blue. Late in the afternoon we landed on the island
            of Terceira in the Azores. We had set our watches ahead two hours at Stevensville. Now we set them ahead again. We took off promptly at seven. This was the last lap of the journey—we’d be in Paris in the morning. Presently our fellow passengers
            settled down for the night. Two of the cushioned chairs were empty, so Craig and I took possession. They were more comfortable than the cots, and as soon as the steward turned out the lights I dropped off to sleep. It was still dark when I
            awoke hours later, but there was enough light for me to distinguish two black masses of land rising from the sea. On one, the beacon of a lighthouse revolved with monotonous regularity. We had just passed over two of the Channel Islands. The
            dawn came rapidly and a pink light edged the eastern horizon. It was not long before we sighted the coast of France. We flew into rosy clouds and, as they billowed about the plane, we caught tantalizing glimpses of the shore line below. The
            steward pointed out one promontory and told us it was Brest. Soon we had a spectacular view of Mont St. Michel and the long causeway over which I had driven years before on a sketching tour in Normandy. I wondered what had become of Mère Poulard
            and her wonderful omelettes and lobster. Some people said they had brought more visitors to Mont St. Michel than the architecture. Very likely she was dead and the Germans had probably disposed of her fabulous cuisine. We had lost two more
            hours in the course of the night, so it was only seven-thirty when we swooped down at Orly field, half an hour from Paris. It was a beautiful morning and the sun was so bright that it took us a few minutes to get accustomed to the glare. As
            we walked over to the airport office, we had our first glimpse of war damage at close range—bombed-out hangars and, scattered about the field, the wreckage of German planes. But the airport was being repaired rapidly. Trim new offices had
            been built and additional barracks were nearing completion. Craig and I booked places on the afternoon plane for London and then climbed onto the bus waiting to take us into Paris. Thanks to various delays in getting out of Washington, we
            had missed the Paris celebration of VE-Day by a margin of three days. So we were about to see the wonderful old city at the beginning of a period of readjustment. But a peaceful Sunday morning is no time to judge any city—least of all Paris.
            Everything looked the same. The arcades along the right side of the Rue de Rivoli and the gardens at the left were empty, as one would expect them to be. We turned into the Rue Castiglione and came to a halt by the column in the Place Vendôme.
            After we had checked our bags at the ATC office, we walked over to the Red Cross Club on the Place de la Concorde. We shaved, washed and then had doughnuts and coffee in the canteen. Our next move was to call Lieutenant Colonel Geoffrey Webb,
            the British officer who was head of the MFA&A Section at SHAEF headquarters in Versailles. Before the war, Colonel Webb had been Slade Professor of Art at Cambridge. I explained to him that Smyth and I had arrived but that our orders directed
            us to report first to Naval Headquarters in London—ComNavEu—and that as soon as we had complied with them we would be back. That was all right with the colonel. He said that Lieutenant Kuhn, USNR, his deputy, was away on a three-day field
            trip and wouldn’t be returning before the middle of the week. And we were primarily Charlie Kuhn’s problem. With that formality out of the way, we retrieved our luggage and wheedled the ATC into giving us transportation to the Royal Monceau,
            the Navy hotel out near the Étoile. It was time to relax and luxuriate in the thought that it was May and that we were in Paris—that climatic and geographic combination so long a favorite theme of song-writers. I thought about this as we drove
            along the Champs Élysées. The song writers had something, all right—Paris in May was a wonderful sight. But they had been mooning about a gala capital filled with carefree people, and the Paris of May 1945 wasn’t like that. Architecturally,
            the city was as elegant as ever, but the few people one saw along the streets looked anything but carefree. And there were no taxis. Taxis have always seemed to me as much a part of Paris as the buildings themselves. In spite of a superficial
            sameness, Paris had an air of empty magnificence that made one think of a beautiful woman struck dumb by shock. I wondered if my thoughts were running away with me, but found that Craig’s impressions were much the same. These musings were
            cut short by our arrival at the hotel. The Navy had done all right for itself. The same efficient French staff that had presided over this de luxe establishment in prewar days was still in charge. I left the Baedekers and photographic paper
            for Charlie Kuhn, and then Craig and I walked to Naval Headquarters in the Rue Presbourg. There we attended to routine matters in connection with our orders. It was almost noon by the time we got squared away, so we retraced our steps to the
            Monceau. Lunch there was a demonstration of what a French chef could do with GI food. Midafternoon found us headed back to Orly in a Navy jeep. Our plane was scheduled to leave at four. This was no bucket-seat job, but a luxurious C-47 equipped
            with chairs of the Pullman-car variety, complete with antimacassars. We landed at Bovingdon less than two hours later and from there took a bus up to London. Naval Headquarters was in Grosvenor Square. With the American Embassy on one side
            of it, the Navy on another, and the park in the center used by the Navy motor pool, the dignified old square was pretty thoroughly Americanized. London was still crowded with our armed forces. The hotels were full, so we were assigned to lodgings
            in Wimpole Street. These were on the third floor of a pleasant, eighteenth century house, within a stone’s throw of No. 50, where Elizabeth Barrett had been wooed and won by Robert Browning. An inspection of our quarters revealed that the
            plumbing was of the Barrett-Browning period; but the place was clean and, anyway, it wasn’t likely that we’d be spending much time there. It had been a long day and we were too tired to think of anything beyond getting a bite to eat and hitting
            the sack. For our two days in London we had “Queen’s weather”—brilliant sunshine and cloudless skies. Our first port of call early the next morning was the Medical Office, where we were given various inoculations. From there Craig and I went
            across the square to the American Embassy for a long session with Sumner Crosby, at that time acting as the liaison between the Roberts Commission and its British counterpart, the Macmillan Committee. Sumner provided us with a great deal of
            useful information. The latest reports from Germany indicated that caches of looted art were being uncovered from day to day. The number of these hiding places ran into the hundreds. The value of their contents was, of course, incalculable.
            Only a fraction of the finds had as yet been released to the press. Craig and I began licking our chops at the prospect of what lay ahead. Had we made a mistake in planning to stay two days in London? Perhaps we could get a plane back to Paris
            that evening. Sumner thought not. There were several things for us to do on the spot, things that would be of use to us in our future activities. One was to call on Colonel Sir Leonard Woolley, the British archaeologist who, with his wife,
            was doing important work for the Macmillan Committee. Another was to see Jim Plaut, a naval lieutenant at the London office of OSS. He would probably have valuable information about German museum personnel. It would be helpful to know the
            whereabouts of certain German scholars, specifically those whose records were, from our point of view, “clean.” Sumner made several appointments for us and then hurried off to keep one of his own. Craig and I stayed on at the office to study
            the reports. Sumner had already given us the glittering highlights. By noon our heads were filled with facts and figures that made E. Phillips Oppenheim seem positively unimaginative. And _The Arabian Nights_—that was just old stuff. It was
            late afternoon when we finished calling on the various people Sumner had advised us to see, but plenty of time remained to do a little sightseeing before dinner. The cabbie took us past Buckingham Palace, along the Embankment, Birdcage Walk,
            the Abbey, the Houses of Parliament and finally to St. Paul’s. What we saw was enough to give a cruel picture of the damage the Germans had inflicted on the fine old monuments of London. Craig and I flew back to Orly the following evening,
            arriving too late to obtain transportation into Paris. We spent an uncomfortable night in the barracks at the airport and drove to the Royal Monceau early the next morning. It was stiflingly hot and I was in a bad humor in spite of the soothing
            effect of a short haircut—the kind Francesca said needed a couple of saber scars to make it look right. My spirits fell still lower when Craig and I were told that we could stay only two nights at the hotel. Since we were assigned to SHAEF,
            it was up to the Army to billet us. It seemed rather unfriendly of the Navy, but that’s the way it was and there wasn’t anything we could do about it. After lunch we set out for Versailles in a Navy jeep. It was a glorious day despite the
            heat, and the lovely drive through the Bois and on past Longchamps made us forget our irritation at the Navy’s lack of hospitality. The office of the Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives Section was in two tiny “between-floor” rooms in the Grandes
            Écuries—the big stables which, together with their matching twin, the Petites Écuries, face the main palace. When we arrived Colonel Webb was deep in conference with a lady war correspondent. The tall, rangy colonel, who reminded me of a humorous
            and grizzled giraffe, came out to welcome Craig and me. His cordiality was overwhelming at first, but we soon learned the reason. Miss Bonney, the correspondent, was giving the colonel a bad time and he needed moral support. She was firing
            a rapid barrage of searching questions, and in some cases the colonel didn’t want to answer. I was fascinated by his technique. He obviously didn’t wish to offend his inquisitor, but on the other hand he wasn’t going to be pressed for an expression
            of opinion on certain subjects. At times he would parry her query with one of his own. At others he would snort some vague reply which got lost in a hearty laugh. Before the interview was over, it was Miss Bonney who was answering the questions—often
            her own—not the colonel. Neither Craig nor I could make much of what we heard, but after Miss Bonney’s departure the colonel took us into his confidence. Somewhere this indomitable lady had got hold of stray bits of information which, properly
            pieced together, made one of the most absorbing stories of the war, as far as Nazi looting of art treasures was concerned. The time was not yet ripe to break the story, according to the colonel, so it had been up to him to avoid giving answers
            which would have filled in the missing pieces of the puzzle. Then the colonel proceeded to tell us about the _Einsatzstab Rosenberg_, the infamous “task force”—to translate the word literally—organized under the direction of Alfred Rosenberg,
            the “ideological and spiritual leader” of the Reich, for the methodical plundering of the great Jewish collections and the accumulated artistic wealth of other recognized “enemies of the state.” Rosenberg was officially responsible for cultural
            treasures confiscated in the occupied countries. He had virtually unlimited resources at his command. In the fall of 1940, not long after his appointment, Rosenberg received a congratulatory letter from Göring in which the Reichsmarschall
            promised to support energetically the work of his staff and to place at its disposal “means of transportation and guard personnel,” and specifically assured him the “utmost assistance” of the Luftwaffe. Even before the war, German agents had
            accumulated exhaustive information concerning collections which were later to be confiscated. The whereabouts of every object of artistic importance was known. Paintings, sculpture, tapestries, furniture, porcelain, enamels, jewels, gold and
            silver—all were a matter of record. When the Nazis occupied Paris, the Rosenberg Task Force was able to go into operation with clocklike precision. And so accurate was their information that in many instances they even knew the hiding places
            in which their more foresighted victims had concealed their valuables. The headquarters of the E.R.R.[1] had been set up in the Musée du Jeu de Paume, the little museum in the corner of the Tuileries Gardens overlooking the Place de la Concorde.
            The large staff was composed mainly of Germans, but some of the members were French. Looted treasures poured into the building, to be checked, labeled and shipped off to Germany. But it was more than a clearing house. The choicest things were
            placed on exhibition and to these displays the top-flight Nazis were invited—to select whatever caught their fancy. Hitler had first choice, Göring second. It did not occur to the members of the E.R.R. staff that their every move was watched.
            A courageous Frenchwoman named Rose Valland had ingratiated herself with the “right people” and had become a trusted member of the staff. During the months she worked at the museum, she had two main objectives. One was to sabotage the daily
            work as much as possible by making intentionally stupid mistakes and by encouraging the French laborers, engaged by the Germans, to do likewise. The other, and far and away the more important, was the compilation of a file, complete with biographical
            data and photographs, of the German personnel at the Jeu de Paume. How she ever accomplished this is a mystery. The colonel said that Mlle. Valland, now a captain in the French Army, was working with the official French committee for Fine
            Arts. She had already provided our Versailles office with a copy of her E.R.R. file. Later in the summer I met Captain Valland, a robust woman with gray hair and the most penetrating brown eyes I have ever seen. I asked her how she had ever
            had the courage to do what she had done. She said with a laugh, “I could never do it again. The Gestapo followed me home every night.” After regaling us with this account of the E.R.R., Colonel Webb whetted our appetites still further with
            an outline of what his deputy, Charlie Kuhn, was up to. As the result of a “signal,” he had taken off by plane for Germany, and at the moment was either in the eastern part of Bavaria or over the Austrian border, trying to trace two truckloads
            of paintings and tapestries which two high-ranking Nazis had spirited away from the Laufen salt mine at the eleventh hour. Latest information indicated that the finest things from the Vienna Museum had been stored at Laufen, which was in the
            mountains east of Salzburg; and it was further believed that the “top cream” of the stuff—the Breughels, Titians and Velásquezes—was in those two trucks. These pictures were world-famous and consequently not marketable, so there was the appalling
            possibility that the highjackers had carried them off with the idea of destroying them—Hitler’s mad Götterdämmerung idea. There was also the possibility that they intended to hold the pictures as a bribe against their own safety. Back at the
            hotel that night, Craig and I reviewed the events of the day. What we had learned from Colonel Webb was only an affirmation of the exciting things we had gleaned from the reports in the London office. We were desperately anxious to get into
            Germany where we could be a part of all these unbelievable adventures instead of hearing about them secondhand. Strict censorship was still in force, so we weren’t able to share our exuberance with our respective families in letters home.
            But we could at least exult together over the fantastic future shaping up before us. We found Charlie Kuhn at the office the next morning. He was a tall quiet fellow with a keen sense of humor, whom I had first known when we had been fellow
            students at Harvard back in the twenties. During the intervening years we had met only at infrequent intervals. He had remained to teach and had become an outstanding member of the Fine Arts faculty in Cambridge, while I had gone to a museum.
            His special field of scholarship was German painting and it was this attribute which had led the Roberts Commission to nominate him for his present assignment as Deputy Chief of the MFA&A Section. He had already been in the Navy for two years
            when this billet was offered him. Notwithstanding his obvious qualifications for his present job, he had so distinguished himself in the earlier work upon which he had been engaged—special interrogation of German prisoners—that it had required
            White House intervention to “liberate” him for his new duties. No closeted scholar, Charlie chafed under the irritations of administrative and personnel problems which occupied most of his time. That morning at Versailles he was fresh from
            his adventures in the field, and we buttonholed him for a firsthand account. Yes, the trucks had been located. They had been abandoned by the roadside, but everything had been found intact. The reports had not been exaggerated: the trucks
            had contained some of the finest of the Vienna pictures and also some of the best tapestries. They were now in a warehouse at Salzburg and would probably remain there until they could be returned to Vienna. As to their condition, the pictures
            were all right; the tapestries had mildewed a bit, but the damage wasn’t serious. It was hard to settle down to the humdrum of office routine after his recital of these adventures. Charlie said he wanted to ship us off to Germany as soon as
            possible because there was so much to be done and so few officers were available. It turned out that we weren’t destined for nearly so swift an invasion of Germany as we had hoped. Later that afternoon Charlie received a letter from the Medical
            Officer at Naval Headquarters in Paris informing him that Lieutenants Howe and Smyth had not completed their course of typhus shots, and that he would not recommend their being sent into Germany until thirty days after the second and final
            shot. Charlie wanted to know what this was all about, and we had to admit that we had not been given typhus injections before leaving the States, and had only received the first one in London. After deliberating about it most of the following
            morning, Colonel Webb and Charlie decided that, if we were willing to take the chance, they’d cut the waiting period to ten days. We were only too willing. Craig and I made good use of the waiting period. We were put to work on the reports
            submitted at regular intervals by our officers in the field. These reports contained information concerning art repositories. It was our job to keep the card file on them up to date; to make a card for each new one; to sort out and place in
            a separate file those which had become obsolete; to check duplications. Each card bore the name of the place, a brief description of the contents, and a map reference consisting of two co-ordinates. In Germany there was much duplication in
            the names of small towns and villages, so these map references were of great importance. There was also a file on outstanding works of art which were known to have been carried off by the Germans or hidden away for safekeeping, but the whereabouts
            of which were as yet unknown—such things, for example, as the crown jewels of the Holy Roman Empire, the Michelangelo _Madonna and Child_ from Bruges, the Ghent altarpiece, the treasure from the Cathedral of Metz, the stained glass from Strasbourg
            Cathedral, and the Veit Stoss altarpiece. The list read like an Almanach de Gotha of the art world. So far as our creature comforts were concerned, they suffered a great decline when we moved out to Versailles. Our lodging there was a barren,
            four-story house at No. 1 Rue Berthier. Craig had a room on the ground floor, while I shared one under the eaves with Charlie Kuhn. Judging from the signs still tacked up in various parts of the house, it had been used as a German billet during
            the occupation; and judging by its meager comforts, only the humblest ranks had been quartered there. No spruce Prussian would have put up with such austerity. A couple of British soldiers also were living there. They were batmen for two officers
            quartered in a near-by hotel and, for a hundred francs a week, they agreed to do for us as well. They brought us hot water in the morning, polished our shoes each day and pressed our uniforms. Outwardly our life was rather magnificent, for
            we usually had our meals at the Trianon Palace Hotel just inside the park grounds. It was a pleasant walk from the Rue Berthier, and an even pleasanter one from the office, involving a short cut behind the main palace and across the lovely
            gardens. On the whole the gardens had been well kept up and a stroll about the terraces or through the long _allées_ was something to look forward to when the weather was fine. Craig and I got into the habit of retiring to a quiet corner of
            the gardens after work with our German books. There we would quiz each other for an hour or two a day. We made occasional trips into Paris but, more often than not, we followed a routine in which the bright lights—what few there were—played
            little part. At the end of our ten-day “incubation” period, Charlie gave us our instructions. We were to go to Frankfurt by air and from there to Bad Homburg by car. At Bad Homburg we were to report to ECAD headquarters, that is, the European
            Civil Affairs Division, where we would be issued further orders. As members of a pool of officers attached to ECAD, we could be shifted about from one part of Germany to another. Charlie told us that he and Colonel Webb would be moving to
            Frankfurt in a few days as SHAEF Headquarters was soon to be set up there. The MFA&A office would continue to function with a joint British and American staff until the dissolution of SHAEF later in the summer. But that would not take place,
            he said, until the four zones of occupation had been established. We left for the airport at six-thirty in the morning. Our French driver asked us which airport we wanted. Craig and I looked at each other in surprise. What field was there
            besides Orly? The answer was Villacoublay. We had never heard of it, so we said Orly. We couldn’t have been more wrong. When we finally reached Villacoublay we found great confusion. We couldn’t even find out whether our plane had taken off.
            After making three attempts to get a coherent answer from the second lieutenant who appeared to be quietly going mad behind the information counter, I gave up. “This is where you take over, Craig,” I said. I had suddenly developed an evil
            headache and had lost all interest in going any place. I walked over to my luggage, which I had dumped in front of the building, and plunked myself down on top of it, put on dark glasses and went to sleep. An hour later, Craig shook me. “Come
            on,” he said. “I’ve found a B-17 that’s going to Frankfurt.” We piled our gear onto a truck and rumbled out over the bumpy field for a distance of half a mile. One of the B-17’s crew was sitting unconcernedly in the grass. “We’d like to go
            to Frankfurt,” said Craig. “Okay,” he said, “we’ll be going along pretty soon.” He was disconcertingly casual. But the trip wasn’t. We ran into heavy fog and got lost, so it took us nearly three hours to make the run which shouldn’t have taken
            more than two. We finally landed in a green meadow near Hanau. Craig said he’d look for transportation if I’d stand guard over our luggage. It was an agreeable assignment. The day was warm, the meadow soft and inviting. I took out my German
            book and a chocolate bar, curled up in the grass and hoped he’d be gone a long time. Craig came back an hour and a half later with a jeep. We were about twenty miles outside Frankfurt. On the way in the driver said that the city had been eighty
            percent destroyed. He hadn’t exaggerated. As we turned into the Mainzer Landstrasse, we saw nothing but gutted buildings on either side. We continued up the Taunus Anlage and I recognized the Opera House ahead. At first I thought it was undamaged.
            Then I saw that the roof was gone, and only the outer walls remained. Most of the buildings were like that. This was just the shell of a city. Our first stop was SHAEF headquarters, newly established in the vast I. G. Farben building which,
            either by accident or design, was completely undamaged. There we got another car to take us to Bad Homburg. The little resort town where the fashionable world of Edward VII’s day had gone to drink the waters and enjoy the mineral baths consisted
            mostly of hotels. Some of them were occupied by our troops. Others were being used as hospitals for wounded German soldiers. The big Kurhaus had received a direct hit, but the rest of the buildings appeared to be undamaged. At ECAD headquarters
            we were assigned a billet in the Grand Hotel Parc. That sounded pretty snappy to us—another Royal Monceau, maybe. The billeting officer must have guessed our thoughts, because he shook his head glumly and said, “’Tain’t anything special. Don’t
            get your hopes up.” It was nice of him to have prepared us for the rat hole which was the Grand Hotel Parc. This shabby structure, built around three sides of a narrow courtyard, had an air of vanished refinement about it, but it could hardly
            have rated a star in Baedeker. Yet it must have had a certain cachet fifty years ago, for in the entrance hallway hung a white marble plaque. Its dim gold letters told us that Bismarck’s widow had spent her declining years “in peaceful happiness
            beneath this hospitable roof.” Our room was on the fourth floor. The stairs, reminiscent of a lighthouse, might have been designed for a mountain goat. We thought we had struck the ultimate in drabness at the Rue Berthier, but this was worse.
            The room itself was worthy of its approach. When I opened the big wardrobe I half expected a body to fall out. Two sofas masquerading as beds occupied corners by the window. The window gave onto the dingy courtyard. We silently made up our
            beds with Army blankets and sprinkled them lavishly with DDT powder. “Do you suppose there’s such a thing as a bathroom?” Craig asked. “I’d sooner expect to find one in an igloo,” I said. “Maybe there’s a pump or a trough somewhere out in
            back. Why don’t you go and see?” [Illustration: The Residenz at Würzburg. The palace of the Prince-Bishops was gutted by fire in March 1945. The magnificent ceiling by Tiepolo miraculously escaped serious damage.] [Illustration: Ruined Frankfurt.

            officers.] When he returned fifteen minutes later he was in high spirits. “There’s a bathroom all right and it’s got hot water,” he said, “but you have to be a combination of Theseus and Daniel Boone to find it. Come along, I’ll show you the
            way.” It was clever of him to find it a second time. I took a piece of red crayon with me and marked little arrows on the walls to show which turns to make. They were a timesaver to us during the next couple days. After breakfast the next
            morning, we telephoned 12th Army Group Headquarters in Wiesbaden and talked with Lieutenant George Stout, USNR, who, with Captain Bancel La Farge, was in charge of the advance office of MFA&A in Germany. Stout suggested that we come on over.
            It was a pleasant drive along the Autobahn, with the blue Taunus mountains in the distance. Parts of Wiesbaden had been badly mauled, but the destruction was negligible compared with Frankfurt. Although many buildings along the main streets
            had been hit, the colonnaded Kurhaus, now a Red Cross Club, was intact. So was the Opera House. We found George on the top floor of a dingy building in the center of the town. I hadn’t seen him for fifteen years but he hadn’t changed. His
            face was a healthy brown, his eyes were as keen and his teeth as dazzlingly white as ever. George was in his middle forties. His oldest boy was in the Navy but George didn’t look a day over thirty. The Roberts Commission had played in luck
            when they had got him. Of course he was an obvious choice—tops in his field, the technical care and preservation of pictures. He was known and respected throughout the world for his brilliant research work at Harvard, where he presided over
            the laboratory of the Fogg Museum. “Bancel’s got jobs lined up for you fellows, but I think he’d like to tell you about them himself,” George said. “He ought to be back tonight.” “Can’t you tell us in a general way what they are?” I asked.
            “I think one of them is going to be in Frankfurt and the other will probably be in Munich. You see, all the stuff from the Merkers mine is in the vaults of the Reichsbank at Frankfurt and it ought to be moved to a place where it can be permanently
            stored.” The “stuff” he referred to was the enormous collection of paintings and sculpture—comprising the principal treasures of the Berlin museums—which George himself had brought out of the Merkers mine in Thuringia. He had carried out the
            operation virtually singlehanded and in the face of extraordinary difficulties just before the end of hostilities. “As for Munich,” he continued, “repositories are springing up like mushrooms all through Bavaria. Most of it is loot and we’re
            going to have to set up some kind of depot where we can put the things until they can be returned to the countries from which the Nazis stole them.” “What are your plans?” I asked. “Well, if the trucks show up,” he said, “I want to get started
            for Siegen this afternoon. That’s in Westphalia. It’s another mine—copper, not salt—and it’s full of things from the Rhineland museums. I’ve got to take them up to Marburg. We have two good depots there.” We lunched with George and then returned
            to Bad Homburg. There wasn’t anything for us to do but wait around until we heard from Captain La Farge. To fill in the time we took our German books and spent the afternoon studying in the Kurpark. The telephone was ringing in the entrance
            lobby as we walked in at five. It was Captain La Farge. He had just returned and wanted to see us at once. I said I didn’t know whether we could get transportation. He chuckled and said, “Tell them a general wants to see you.” Craig and I
            dashed over to the Transportation Office and tried it out. It worked. So, for the second time that day, we found ourselves on the road to Wiesbaden. Captain La Farge was waiting for us in the office where we had seen George that morning. He
            was a tall, slender man in his early forties. With a high-domed head and a long, rather narrow face, he was the classic New Englander. His eyes were hazel and, at that first meeting, very weary. But he had one of the most ingratiating smiles
            and one of the most pleasant voices I had ever heard. He reminded me of an early Copley portrait. Without much preamble he launched into a detailed explanation of the plans he had for us. “I want you to take over the Frankfurt job,” he said
            to me, “and I am sending you down to Munich, Smyth. As George probably told you, we’ve got to set up two big depots. The one in Frankfurt will be mainly for German-owned art which is now coming in from repositories all over this part of Germany.
            The one in Munich will be chiefly for loot, though there will be German-owned things down in Bavaria too. Both jobs are equally interesting, equally important and, above all, equally urgent.” We were to get started without delay. Craig would
            be attached to the Regional Military Government office in Munich, I to the Military Government Detachment in Frankfurt. Captain La Farge suggested that I investigate the possibility of requisitioning the university buildings for a depot, and
            advised Craig to consider one of the large Nazi party buildings in Munich which he had been told was available. On the way home that night Craig and I compared notes on our new assignments. I was frankly envious of Craig, not only because
            there was something alluring about all that loot, but because I loved Munich and the picturesque country around it. In turn, Craig thought I had drawn a fascinating job—one that involved handling the wonderful riches of Berlin’s “Kaiser Friedrich,”
            admittedly one of the world’s greatest museums. The following morning we parted on the steps of the Grand Parc Hotel. Craig took off first, in a jeep with trailer attached, a crusty major for his companion. Half an hour later a jeep appeared
            for me. On the way over to Frankfurt I thought about the experiences of the past three weeks. It had been fun sharing them with Craig and I wished that we might have continued this odyssey together. I didn’t realize how soon our paths were
            to cross again. (2) _ASSIGNED TO FRANKFURT_ The Military Government Detachment had its headquarters in a gray stone building behind the Opera House. It was one of the few in the city that had suffered relatively little damage. I reported to
            the Executive Officer, a white-haired major named James Franklin. After I had explained the nature of the work I was expected to do, he took me around to the office of Lieutenant Julius Buchman, the Education and Religious Affairs Officer,
            who had also the local MFA&A problems as part of his duties. Buchman couldn’t have been more pleasant, and said he’d do everything he could to help. There was an air of quiet good humor about him that I liked at once. I learned that he was
            an architect by profession and had studied at the Bauhaus in Dessau before the war. He spoke fluent German.</div>

					<p>Imagine you are scrolling through a webpage and, at the bottom of a series of paragraphs you've been reading, you see a green box with white text that reads ‚ÄúNEXT.‚Äù Immediately, you know that this is a clickable button. Because you are interested, you move your mouse to click the button. Just as your cursor leaves the white background and crosses into the green shape, the button grows slightly in scale and the text turns yellow.</p>

					<p>Are these kinds of uses of technology good or bad design? Does the excitement that the visual effect might give justify its uselessness? Design is about more than just functionality, of course, but in what ways does good design expand beyond utility? Does this button effect qualify for one of those ways?</p>

					<p>I want to think about this in a pseudo-Socratic method:</p>

					<p class="section-emoji">üí†</p>

					<p><b>The scale-up on hover button effect for elements that already look like buttons is bad design because it does more than it needs to. It‚Äôs unecessary.</b></p>

					<p>Since when has unecessary been a sufficient qualifier of bad design? Are ornaments on corinthian columns necessary? They're certainly not structural. Aren't they at least beautiful, interesting, or impressive? Don‚Äôt each of those categories qualify as necessary to good design? In this printed title page from 1928, we see lots of ornament.<span id="ref-1"><a href="#note-1" style="color:#dd0000;"><sup>1</sup></a></span> Maybe there is a cultural impact it carries. It may provide pleasure appropriate to the publication. It may draw attention where attention sometimes (even if rarely) is not drawn. It does not communicate the information that the text communicates, but it may help or it may do something else useful.</p>

					<p><b>Maybe it's better to avoid the word <i>unecessary</i>. A small upscaling of a button on hover is bad design because it doesn't fulfill the intended purpose.</b></p>
					
					<p>Actually, it‚Äôs very likely that the hover effect does fulfill the intended purpose. It‚Äôs reasonable to assume that the kind of person who uses those animated effets intends to make the experience of interacting with website buttons more fun and visually eye-catching. Though we cannot know the intention in every design choice, this is a safe and charitable assumption.</p>
					
					<p><b>Then it must be that there are certain intentions and purposes that, when sought to be fulfilled, constitute bad design.</b></p>
					
					<p>How do we measure what intentions and purposes are worthwhile towards good design? Don‚Äôt we have to first understand what makes design good? We‚Äôve already considered that good design does not necessitate that every design element be functionally necessary towards the end of communication of content.</p>
					
					<p><b>Having an understanding of the nature of design is key to understanding what makes for good design. Design is human action. It is political action. It is philosophical action. It is aesthetic action. It is emotional action. It is social action. It is economic action. &c. Insofar as design meets the goals and necessities of its nature it is good.</b></p>

					<p>Maybe to better understand what makes for good design, we must better understand philosophy, politics, economics, culture, language, &c. Good design arises from a multi-disciplinary mindset. Designing, like painting, requires technical skill; good design, also like painting, reveals more than practiced skill.</p>

					<p class="section-emoji">üí†</p>

					<p>The better designer is the one who makes extra effort to understand the nature of what they are doing when they design. What cultural narratives are they taking part in? How can they do this ethically? What role do they play in educating the public through their design choices (apart from mere content-communication)? How can they cause helpful disruption? When is disruption helpful anyway? When is it best for something to be just pretty and when is it better for it to be ugly?</p>

					<p>All things considered, is it good design to give hover effects to obvious buttons on webpages? Maybe not. Is it good design to utilize animation technology just for fun? Is it appropriate to use things just for fun? Maybe. Who tends to read that kind of article and visit that kind of site? Is it the kind of person who needs less animated buttons in their life? Who knows?</p>

					<p>A good designer cares more about graphics, about how things look and appear. A good designer asks questions, even if they can't seem to find answers to all of them. A good designer reads about more than just design. A good designer tries to benefit people by considering the nature and effects of their work. A good designer does not view design as just a skill or a trade. A good designer is intentional with their agency. Good design is responsible and considerate.</p>

					As I study communication design at Parsons, I find myself constantly asking questions and wondering about things all over the city, at home, in class, wherever and whenever. I want to be able to explore these curiosities intentionally so as to bear some fruit instead of waste time. My hope is that storing some of my mind junk in this  online bin will see it ferment into something much more palatable.<br>
					<br>
					One of the topics related to design I am most interested in exploring at the start of this blog is how to approach design as a Christian. It must mean more than designing Christian books (though I want to do that) or instagram inspirational quotes by dead, white, male theologians.<br>
					<br>
					Mark Noll's writing<span id="ref-1"><a href="#note-1" style="color:#dd0000;"><sup>1</sup></a></span> about the absence of serious Christian thought regarding "traditionally" non-Christian subjects is part of the inspiration behind this blog. I don't mean to make this an academic blog. I'm not capable of that at this point. I just want to think hard and think seriously without worrying where it will fit in the hierarchy of thoughtfulness.<br>
					<br>
					I also plan to write about other topics or questions. Hope you'll find something beneficial to you if you visit my little block on the web again!

        <div class="body-column iv">
          <span style="color:var(--purple);">
            A small neutral camp called the Joint Security Area (JSA) lies on
            the border between North and South Korea, in the area known as the
            Demilitarised Zone (DMZ). Both were created under the terms of the
            armistice signed in 1953 which ended the Korean War.<br /><br />
            The JSA - also called Panmunjom, or the Truce Village - is where
            negotiations between both sides take place. Most recently, it was
            where US President Donald Trump stepped into North Korea, becoming
            the first US leader to do so.<br /><br />
            But in 1976, guards and soldiers from both sides could wander all
            around the small zone. North Koreans, South Koreans and US guards
            would mingle together.<br /><br />
            Bill Ferguson was just 18 years old in August 1976. He was part of
            the US army support group in the JSA, under the command of the
            popular Captain Arthur Bonifas.<br /><br />
            "Capt Bonifas really wanted us to enforce the terms of the
            armistice," Mr Ferguson says. "We were encouraged to intimidate the
            North Koreans into allowing the full freedom of movement within the
            JSA."<br /><br />
            At the time, US soldiers were only allowed to serve in the JSA if
            they were over six feet (1.83m) tall, Mr Ferguson says, as part of
            this intimidation.<br /><br />
            "We didn't get along with them at all," Mr Ferguson remembers,
            although he admits that occasionally North Korean guards would trade
            propaganda from their country for Marlboro cigarettes.<br /><br />
            Strict rules limited the number of guards from both sides and the
            weapons they could carry. Troops from one side would try to
            antagonise the other, which often led to violence. While Mr Ferguson
            was there, one US guard had his arm broken by North Koreans after he
            accidentally drove his jeep behind their main building, the
            Panmungak pavilion.<br /><br />
            US Lieutenant David "Mad Dog" Zilka meanwhile encouraged men to go
            out on patrol carrying big sticks, to bang on the walls and windows
            of North Korean barracks and to use as weapons if need be.<br /><br />
            "Zilka would take us out on these clandestine patrols," says Mike
            Bilbo, a platoon mate and friend of Bill Ferguson's in the JSA.
            "Once or twice we caught a North Korean where they weren't supposed
            to be and kind of beat him up a little bit - not too bad."<br /><br />
            Mr Bilbo says these aggressive actions on both sides may have
            prompted the incident over the tree. "But there's just no cause for
            them to do what they did."<br /><br />
            The branches of the poplar obscured the view between a checkpoint
            and an observation post. A team of US and South Korean men were
            ordered to prune it back.<br /><br />
            On the first attempt, North Korea objected, claiming any landscaping
            work required permission from both parties. Heavy rain thwarted the
            second try.<br /><br />
            Capt Bonifas - in the final days of his deployment in Korea -
            decided to monitor the third attempt personally, on 18 August.<br /><br />
            A group of North Koreans appeared, demanding they stop cutting the
            branches. When Capt Bonifas ignored them, the North Koreans attacked
            - using clubs and axes wrenched from the gardening party to bludgeon
            the captain and US Lieutenant Mark Barrett to death.<br /><br />
            Sirens went off throughout the DMZ and troops were put on high
            alert. Word of the attack quickly reached Washington DC, where
            Secretary of State Henry Kissinger called for an attack on the North
            Korean barracks to ensure "a high probability of getting the people
            who did this".<br /><br />
            "They have killed two Americans and if we do nothing, they will do
            it again," he told a briefing. "We have to do something."<br /><br />
            In the end, Kissinger was overruled. While military and political
            leaders debated how best to respond, they all agreed on one thing:
            the tree had to go.<br /><br />
            Commanders came up with a plan to prune the tree back using a
            massive show of force. It was designated Operation Paul Bunyan -
            named after a giant lumberjack in US folklore - and scheduled for 21
            August.<br /><br />
            How the North Koreans might respond to this force though was another
            concern.<br /><br />
            Wayne Johnson was a 19-year-old US private with the 2nd Battalion
            9th Infantry, stationed at Camp Liberty Bell just outside the JSA.
            He drove his commanding officer to a briefing the night before the
            tree-cutting operation, and saw a lieutenant ask what would happen
            to his unit.<br /><br />
            "I watched the officer turn around with this piece of chalk and draw
            an X through our unit designation on the chalk board, then turn back
            around and say, 'Any more questions?'" Mr Johnson says.<br /><br />
            The teenager was tasked with rigging Camp Liberty Bell with
            explosives that night to destroy the base in case the North Koreans
            attacked and tried to capture it. Then he drove up to meet the rest
            of his unit at the JSA, passing through US and South Korean
            checkpoints as he went.<br /><br />
            "I thought that was kind of funny," he says. "At the DMZ gates I had
            to go through a checkpoint there. I'm thinking, what the hell, don't
            these guys know that things are going to happen?"<br /><br />
            Bill Ferguson and Mike Bilbo spent the night preparing for their own
            mission - driving in and securing what is known as the Bridge of No
            Return to prevent North Korean forces driving into the JSA and
            interfering with the tree cutting.<br /><br />
            "A couple of guys got sick - the tension, the nervousness of it," Mr
            Bilbo says. "Everybody's on pins and needles. And when we pulled out
            from our camp, there's Cobra helicopters hovering just off the
            ground getting ready to take off.<br /><br />
            "I looked down the road and here is all these as far as I can see
            truckloads of soldiers. It's an invasion force of some kind."<br /><br />
            Ted Schaner was a 27-year-old captain with the 2nd Battalion 9th
            Infantry, and one of the men in the helicopters hovering overhead as
            the soldiers drove in towards the tree.<br /><br />
            "It was an impressive line up there," he says. They, too, were
            unsure whether war was about to break out. "We were, of course,
            hoping it wouldn't, but I felt... we were prepared if that's what
            was going to happen. I was proud of my soldiers."<br /><br />
            Alpha company of the 2nd Battalion 9th Infantry - Wayne Johnson's
            company - remained on the ground.<br /><br />
            "We were prepared not to come back," says Joel Brown, then a
            19-year-old private with Alpha Company. "It felt kind of surreal...
            We've been here since 1950 and it's all going to go down over this
            tree."<br /><br />
            Bill Ferguson and Mike Bilbo's platoon arrived just as the fog was
            lifting. Their truck driver reversed onto the Bridge of No Return to
            block the crossing, while the men jumped out armed only with pistols
            and axe handles.<br /><br />
            "Almost immediately a dump truck comes up, and it's got engineers in
            it," says Mr Bilbo. "I've never seen chainsaws so long."<br /><br />
            Charles Twardzicki of the 2nd Engineer Battalion had spent the night
            practising to use the tools. The 25-year-old sergeant had suggested
            bringing in heavier equipment to take the tree down, but officers
            feared it would be too difficult to speedily get them out if the
            North Koreans tried to intervene - leaving them to cut back the
            branches by hand.<br /><br />
            "We have to use a ladder to get up into the tree," he says. "We got
            one guy on the headache board [behind the truck's cab] cutting one,
            and I'm cutting another. His chainsaw is about where my head is."<br /><br />
            As the engineers chopped, the troops watched North Korean forces
            arrive in trucks and buses.<br /><br />
            "We can see the North Koreans across from us setting up machine
            guns," says Mike Bilbo. "I'm looking around where I'm going to go
            when the artillery comes in. In fact, all the artillery - ours and
            theirs - was zeroed in on us."<br /><br />
            Several US soldiers remember they and the South Korean special
            forces who accompanied them had sneaked heavy weapons into the area
            under sandbags on the floor of their trucks. Some South Koreans even
            strapped claymore mines to their chests and held the detonators in
            their hands, goading the North Koreans to attack.<br /><br />
            "I understood some of the bad words in Korean and it was a lot of
            bad words, let me tell you," says Wayne Johnson, who was standing
            just yards away from Bill Ferguson and Mike Bilbo during the tree
            cutting.<br /><br />
            But the North Koreans did not intervene. Once the branches were cut
            down, the US and South Korean forces quickly withdrew from the JSA -
            although other forces in the DMZ remained on alert. The entire
            operation was over in less than 45 minutes.<br /><br />
            "Everybody was jazzed up," Mike Bilbo says. "Symbolic things bother
            the North Koreans more than the actual."<br /><br />
            "One day I went out and sawed a couple pieces of the branch...
            Everybody's got a piece of that damned tree," he says.<br /><br />
            Soldiers felt they had made the North Koreans lose face, something
            they knew would enrage them. But others remained angry.<br /><br />
            "I felt that we got the worst part of it," says Charles Twardzicki.
            "We were just trimming the tree and you killed a couple of our
            officers - so we cut it down... I thought it was a pretty poor
            trade."<br /><br />
            "We didn't want to be the ones responsible for starting a whole new
            war, but we were also dying for the chance to extract some blood,"
            says Bill Ferguson.<br /><br />
            Rules in the JSA changed shortly after Operation Paul Bunyan. North
            Koreans were separated from UN forces with the small concrete
            barrier that President Donald Trump stepped over in July - putting
            an end to the mingling and intimidation tactics.<br /><br />
            "That was a major letdown," Bill Ferguson says. "North Korea was
            never that fond with that arrangement, it being a neutral area... To
            me and several others enforcing the line through the JSA, it was
            basically a capitulation."<br /><br />
            However, a rare expression of regret from then-North Korean leader
            Kim Il-Sung about the deaths of the US soldiers on the day of the
            tree cutting made many realise they had sufficiently shocked the
            country with the vast display of US firepower.<br /><br />
            Troops at Camp Liberty Bell and the JSA stayed on high alert after
            the operation, in case of retaliation. It was weeks before the men
            could return to their regular routine.<br /><br />
            "Nobody had gone down to the [local town] for over a month and I
            think that some of those bars were about to go bankrupt," says Wayne
            Johnson. "It was kind of, okay, business as usual, let's go back."

        <h1>In the Korean DMZ, Wildlife Thrives</h1>
        <div class="body-column iv">
          <span style="color:var(--green);">
            The quiet of the late-winter morning is interrupted by a staccato of
            gunshots.<br /><br />
            “Military drills,” shrugs Kim Seung-ho, 58, the director of the DMZ
            Ecology Research Institute, a nonprofit organization that does
            research on the wildlife in the Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ, which is
            the border area between North and South Korea. A thick blanket of
            fog seeps over the forested hills on this late-winter morning as Kim
            stands, searching the horizon for birds, on the bank of the Imjin
            River just north of Paju, South Korea.<br /><br />
            This morning, Kim and the institute’s intern Pyo Gina, 24, are on
            their weekly trip to count birds just outside the DMZ, a
            155-mile-long, 2.5-mile-wide strip of land that has been virtually
            untouched by humans for more than six decades. This strip of land
            became an unintentional wildlife sanctuary when the two Koreas
            pulled back from the area after an armistice was signed in their
            1950-53 war.<br /><br />
            The DMZ is fortified with tall, barbed-wire fences, riddled with
            land mines and heavily guarded by the respective countries’
            militaries, keeping all human disturbances to a minimum. After
            people left the area, plants and wildlife were able to grow
            unrestrained. But with increasing goodwill between North and South
            Korea, environmentalists like Kim fear that the protected nature of
            the area is changing and may lead to detrimental effects on the
            wildlife.<br /><br />
            “I can’t help but worry that this area will face a serious threat.
            If we had preserved the region because we had agreed it’s
            environmentally valuable, then it can be kept intact regardless of
            political circumstances. But this region was preserved because of
            the presence of military forces,” says Kim. “Once the military
            tension disappears, it may naturally follow that people feel a
            strong urge to transform the area.”<br /><br />
            Even with tentative overtures toward peace, the two Koreas appear to
            be far from a place where the DMZ would disappear completely. Talks
            of a peace agreement have come up in the past, like a peace
            declaration made in 2000, but progress has been slow. Despite
            positive measures at a summit between North and South Korean leaders
            last fall, President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s
            failed summit in Hanoi in February was a setback for all.<br /><br />
            “A sea eagle!” gasps Pyo. The white-tailed eagle coasts on spread
            wings before quickly ducking around a bend in the Imjin and is lost
            to sight.<br /><br />
            According to South Korea’s Ministry of Environment, more than 5,000
            species of plants and animals have been identified in the area,
            including more than 100 that are protected. Vulnerable,
            near-threatened and endangered animals in the DMZ include the
            Siberian musk deer, white-naped crane, red-crowned crane, Asiatic
            black bear, cinereous vulture and long-tailed goral — a species of
            wild goat.<br /><br />
            Kim and Pyo count birds in the Civilian Control Zone, an area up to
            about 6 miles wide that runs along the southern side of the DMZ.
            Because of the restricted nature of the DMZ itself, the institute
            can only do research on the periphery. Although public access to the
            civilian zone is also restricted and the perimeter is lined by
            barbed wire and military guard posts, Kim has clearance to enter for
            research purposes.<br /><br />
            The CCZ is mainly used for agriculture — farmers are allowed in to
            work their fields and the acres of rice paddies grown inside the
            perimeter are a quiet feeding ground in the winter for many
            migratory birds.<br /><br />
            “Preserving the DMZ area should also mean preserving the Civilian
            Control Zone,” says Kim, standing on a narrow path between rice
            paddies. “If we only preserve the DMZ proper, the variety of birds
            that come here will be curtailed. Small forest birds can both find
            enough food and inside the DMZ, but bigger birds come out here for
            food and go back in the DMZ just to sleep.”<br /><br />
            The endangered red-crowned crane, one of the rarest cranes in the
            world, winters in the area, relying on the spent grains left in the
            fields of the CCZ for food and sleeping in the quiet of the DMZ.
            There are only about 3,000 of this type of crane left in the world,
            according the International Crane Foundation. The civilian zone
            plays an important role in the preservation of the DMZ wildlife,
            acting as a buffer to minimize traffic to the edges of the DMZ
            itself.<br /><br />
            In a sign of thawing tensions, the two Koreas began a joint project
            in October to remove land mines from the DMZ. Development projects
            are in the works, as well as roads and railroads and, eventually,
            possible development in the civilian zone.<br /><br />
            “Demining inevitably destroys the nature,” says Jung Suyoung, 37, a
            taxonomy expert and researcher at the National DMZ Botanical Garden,
            as he looks out from the grounds toward the edge of the zone, less
            than 5 miles away. He fears the detrimental effects of digging up
            land mines and the displacement of plants that is inevitable in the
            process.<br /><br />
            “Some, including myself, argue that we should leave the DMZ as it is
            and try not to utilize the land,” he says.<br /><br />
            The botanical garden, opened in 2016, is filled with plants
            indigenous to the DMZ. It spills down a landscaped hillside in a
            valley encircled by mountains.<br /><br />
            Inside a greenhouse, a group of researchers fill hundreds of wide,
            flat trays with soil and carefully sow long, black seeds from the
            hosta plant, a leafy native species that won’t grow tall enough to
            disrupt the military’s view of the zone — a limitation the
            researchers must work around when planning their operations. The
            seeds will eventually grow into low-lying, bushy plants that the
            researchers plan to return to the edges of the DMZ to repopulate
            areas affected by landslides and invasive plant growth.<br /><br />
            Efforts to preserve the DMZ and surrounding areas are underway. The
            Ministry of the Environment in South Korea says it will announce
            measures this year to protect the environment before more
            development in the area. Talks will be held with the defense
            ministry and other key players before finalizing conservation
            guidelines.<br /><br />
            The South Korean government is also pushing for the entire DMZ to be
            named a biosphere reserve through UNESCO, as a joint effort with
            North Korea. This allocation would require a wide buffer zone that
            limits development in areas alongside the DMZ. A previous
            application by the South Korean government in 2012 failed, in part
            because of a lack of rules limiting development by landowners in the
            surrounding areas.<br /><br />
            Kim and Pyo, along with a handful of institute volunteers, continue
            their research every week. The institute plans to use data they
            collect to advise the government on where it might be best to build
            roads and buildings and where people could come and go with the
            least amount of disruption to the animals.<br /><br />
            “It’s a sad reality that we have preserved the area because we can
            get killed if we go inside — not because of an ethical sense of duty
            to preserve the nature,” Kim says after returning from the bird
            count, having tallied 32 different species of birds in just a few
            hours.<br /><br />
            “Love of the nature is indeed my motivation, but at the same time, I
            do think the nature can provide answers to the problems humankind
            suffers from,” he says. “We have to protect it — force it, if
            necessary — because it’s an important asset for the future.”<br /><br />

          3 North Korean defectors talk about what it was like crossing the
          demilitarized zone.<br /><br />All three men were former soldiers who
          guarded the North Korean border.

            >He was there to escape.<br /><br />
            He tried to act as cool as possible, and when the guard finally
            turned away, he started running, frantically, until he was lost from
            sight in the valley.<br /><br />
            It was Sept. 27, 2016, when Kim, now a sophomore political science
            major at Seoul-based Sogang University, defected through the heavily
            fortified border that spans the Korean peninsula. He chose to escape
            the communist regime’s military service and flee to South Korea,
            where he could live a life with the freedom to choose. That journey
            was the toughest moment in his life.<br /><br />
            “To hide myself from the North Korean guard posts’ watch, I ran deep
            into the valley,” Kim, 25, recalled. “For hours I wandered in the
            woods, round and round. I cut myself on a tree branch and almost
            died falling off a cliff. For the first time in life, I prayed for
            god’s mercy although I had never been to church.”<br /><br />
            Six North Korean soldiers in the past three years have run for a new
            life to South Korea by crossing the demilitarized zone, aka DMZ. Kim
            is one of those courageous young men in their 20s who crawled,
            bolted, hid his way across the 2.5-mile-wide DMZ, the most heavily
            armed border in the world, filled with mines from the Korean War
            era. For some, the life-risking escape took less than an hour, while
            for others it took days.<br /><br />
            In the last three years, 3,682 North Koreans have escaped to South
            Korea, according to the Unification Ministry. Only six of them --
            less than 0.002% -- ran across the untouched area of tension to
            defect. South Korea's Defense Ministry neither confirmed nor denied
            the number of defectors through the DMZ. A majority of defectors
            tend to use routes through a third country like China and Thailand,
            which is also risky but without the threat of gunfire from
            colleagues at the DMZ.<br /><br />
            The DMZ is a 160-mile-long stretch of land dividing the Korean
            peninsula since the Korean war paused in 1953. With the symbolic
            38th parallel in the middle, soldiers from each side monitor the
            opposition, keeping in mind that the Korean war never officially
            stopped. The two Koreas agreed to a ceasefire that's so far lasted
            for over 60 years.<br /><br />
            Soldiers working at guard posts along the border are not only given
            the role of surveilling the opposition, but also keeping an eye on
            their own colleagues, who may attempt to escape. All soldiers on
            each side carry loaded guns.<br /><br />
            "I witnessed a soldier, not so different from myself, being executed
            by firing squad when he was caught trying to flee," An Chan-il, a
            66-year-old defector and North Korea expert, told ABC News. He said
            that he kept the dead soldier's badge during his own escape to at
            least give the man's soul a chance to have a look at South Korea.<br /><br />
            An escaped the communist regime on July 27, 1979. The rainy season
            had just begun so the weather was foggy and nippy. He believed that
            heavy fog could help him hide.<br /><br />
            In order to prevent intrusion into the DMZ, layers of barbed-wire
            fence stand on the North Korean side, warning soldiers not to come
            too close. At major points, the wire fence exposes electricity
            strong enough to bounce off an adult. An, a first sergeant, was in
            charge of the button that turned the electricity on and off.<br /><br />
            "When the commander called that evening to turn off the electricity
            for patrol purpose, I took the chance," An said. "I told my
            colleague not to turn it back on until I came back and exited the
            guard post. I ran for South."<br /><br />
            As a soldier in charge of wire fence, An remembered where the hidden
            emergency door was. He smashed the lock with his rifle while there
            was still no electricity. He ran toward the South Korean guard post
            to his right and stayed low until the sun came up the next
            morning.<br /><br />
            Unlike An, who knew how to avoid electricity running through the
            barbed-wire fence, Kim chose the ragged valley to avoid mines buried
            in fields and looked for cracks under the fence that were safe
            enough to get through. He assumed that electricity won't be running
            on the fences above water.<br /><br />
            "I dug into the soil to make room just enough for myself to pass
            through," Kim said, remembering the day of defection as the hardest
            moment in his life. "After running and crawling in the mountainside
            for more than four hours, I was so exhausted that I even thought of
            killing myself with [the] rat poison I had in pocket for
            emergency."<br /><br />
            After Kim crossed two fences, he finally arrived at the Bukhan
            riverside. He crossed the river on foot where the water level was
            only up to his waist. He remembered the width of the river to be
            about 70 meters [about 230 feet] where he crossed it.<br /><br />
            "I was relieved for the first time that I made it to the other side
            when I crossed that river, because there were words back in the
            North Korean army that it was South Korea just across that river,"
            Kim said.<br /><br />
            To Kim's dismay, he confronted yet another fence on the South Korean
            side. This time it was so thick and the roots were so strongly
            buried to the ground that there was no way he could dig a hole
            underneath. Instead of finding a way around it, he decided to climb
            over the fence. In doing so, the wires scratched his arms and ripped
            his uniform. Exhausted, Kim laid himself in front of the South
            Korean guard post speechless until the soldiers noticed him.<br /><br />
            While it took over a day for An and Kim to arrive in South Korea, it
            took only a few hours for Han Yengsoo to defect. Han, now a
            45-year-old subway operator, defected June 12, 1995. It only took
            him three hours to cross the DMZ and knock on the South Korean guard
            post on what he described as a sunny day.<br /><br />
            "A number of coincidences helped my defection that day," Han
            explained. "For the first time since I started military service, I
            was sent to the DMZ by myself to collect edible greens, which let me
            escape free from colleagues. And there was no electricity on the
            wire fence at the time due to a power shortage in North Korea. Plus,
            I did not step on mines, which could have killed me on the spot."<br /><br />
            As Han stood at the 38th parallel, he left one foot on the North's
            side and the other on the South's for half an hour, trying to decide
            which would be better for his future -- returning home or starting a
            new life in South Korea. He chose South.<br /><br />
            "I threw pebbles to knock on the guard post gate to let them know
            that I defected from North," Han said. He found out later that the
            local media called his case a "knock defection."<br /><br />
            Han told ABC News that at first he thought he could easily return to
            North Korea if he didn't enjoy life in South Korea. He was already
            well off in North Korea, with a predictable life ahead of him. But
            he realized after a seven-month-long investigation at the national
            intelligence that defection was a one-way trip.<br /><br />
            The North Korean army is fully aware that soldiers who stare at the
            southern side all day long are exposed to propaganda flyers and
            broadcasts from the south. That's why only young men from relatively
            wealthy families or well-recognized backgrounds are assigned to work
            near the border, Han said.<br /><br />
            "Those who are assigned service at the border are mostly from good
            backgrounds," Han said. He noted that he, too, came from an
            established family, with his father being dispatched to Libya as a
            dentist at one point and his mother a school teacher in North Korea.
            "The army assigns soldiers who can have affluent lifestyles in North
            Korea, so that there is less temptation for flight."<br /><br />
            Similarly, Kim's hometown was Pyongyang and his father worked as a
            secretary in a steel factory. An was already a Worker's Party member
            when he defected -- his father worked as an official for the Kim Il
            Sung regime.<br /><br />
            North and South Korea pledged to demilitarize the joint security
            area in Panmunjom after the Pyongyang inter-Korean summit in
            September 2018. Since October, security guards from both sides work
            unarmed at the Panmunjom. North and South Korea's defense each got
            rid of 10 out of 11 guard posts built along the border, confirmed by
            each sides in December.</span

          Life Inside the DMZ?<br /><br />Scary, but There's 5G and a Great

            >Taesung Freedom Village, South Korea — For decades, a village of
            188 people has enjoyed perks that few others in South Korea have,
            with its men exempted from mandatory military service and its 46
            households getting special tax cuts.<br /><br />
            These are the rewards for carving out a life in what has been called
            the scariest place on Earth.<br /><br />
            Taesung Freedom Village is the only place inhabited by South Korean
            civilians inside the heavily armed Demilitarized Zone that separates
            the South from North Korea.<br /><br />
            In recent weeks, villagers have been given another reward: South
            Korea’s main mobile phone carrier, KT Corp., has installed a
            fifth-generation, or 5G, ultrafast communications network, one of
            the first such systems installed for any South Korean town.<br /><br />
            “This is more useful than my own children, who all live outside,”
            said Go Geum-sik, 73. “Outside” is how villagers refer to the world
            beyond their constricted boundaries.<br /><br />
            With the 5G service, Ms. Go demonstrated how she can now simply push
            a button on a hand-held device to instantly alert the village mayor,
            as well as the community center, if she or her husband has a medical
            emergency. “There is no use calling 911,” Ms. Go said, “because they
            can’t come here.”<br /><br />
            As South Korea raced to build one of the world’s first nationwide 5G
            networks, Taesung emerged as an attractive candidate where the
            country could show off its high-tech prowess to both the world and
            its bellicose neighbor.<br /><br />
            When the Korean War was halted with an uneasy truce in 1953, the
            Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ, was created to keep the warring armies
            apart.<br /><br />
            Almost all villagers were cleared from the two-and-a-half-mile-wide
            buffer zone, which became one of the world’s most heavily fortified
            frontiers, dotted with minefields and sealed off with barbed-wire
            fences, tank traps and legions of battle-ready troops on both
            sides.<br /><br />
            Any attempt to defect across the border could trigger a hail of
            gunfire.<br /><br />
            Only two villages were allowed to stay inside: Taesung in the South
            Korean half of the DMZ, and a mile away across the borderline, North
            Korea’s Kijong “Peace Village.”<br /><br />
            No communication has since been allowed between the villages that
            had been neighbors for centuries, making it impossible for Park
            Pil-seon, 82, a Taesung villager, to find out whether his elder
            brother in Kijong is still alive.<br /><br />
            In the postwar decades, Taesung and Kijong became pawns in a
            propaganda war between the two Koreas, with both sides investing in
            their own model village to extol the virtues of their respective
            political systems. Today, Kijong is mostly empty, with its
            once-bright pastel paint on its apartment buildings fading,
            according to South Korean soldiers.<br /><br />
            But South Korea’s determination to keep Taesung populated comes with
            challenges; villagers are expected to forgo much of the freedom and
            services other South Koreans take for granted.<br /><br />
            Whenever villagers venture to their rice paddies near the borderline
            just 1,300 feet away, they are shadowed by South Korean soldiers.
            They also live with a midnight-to-sunrise curfew and a door-to-door
            roll call every night.<br /><br />
            When they invite friends from outside the DMZ to visit, villagers
            have to apply for approval two weeks in advance. Once a car enters
            the DMZ, its navigation map goes blank. Soldiers must escort all
            visitors.<br /><br />
            Taesung has no gym, no hospital, no supermarket, no restaurant. If a
            villager orders Chinese takeout, the last military checkpoint
            outside the DMZ is as far as the delivery vehicle can come. The dish
            must be left there for the villager to pick up.<br /><br />
            A bus comes to the village four times a day.<br /><br />
            “Transportation is the biggest headache, especially if you, like me,
            don’t drive,” Ms. Go said.<br /><br />
            The new 5G services are intended to ease some of the burdens.<br /><br />
            Before 5G arrived, rice farmers had to ask for a military escort to
            go to a reservoir a mile away to use a water pump. Now, they can do
            it from their homes through an app on their smartphones. With the
            same app, they can also control the sprinklers in their bean
            patches.<br /><br />
            For years, women wanted to take yoga classes but no instructors
            would come. Now, yoga lessons are streamed onto large screens at the
            community center.<br /><br />
            At the village’s only school, Taesung Elementary, students can now
            play interactive online games. On a recent visit, they could be seen
            having fun hurling actual balls at virtual targets streaming down a
            wall.<br /><br />
            Such amenities are important for the survival of the school. Like
            other rural villages in South Korea, Taesung has lost many of its
            young couples to big cities in recent decades. Today, only seven of
            the school’s 35 students are Taesung natives. The rest are bused in
            daily from Munsan, the nearest town outside the DMZ.<br /><br />
            At the school, students benefit from personalized attention, with as
            many as 21 teachers and staff members for the 35 pupils. This and
            other incentives at the school make it popular among Munsan parents.
            For one opening in the first-grade class this year, 16 Munsan
            children applied.<br /><br />
            “Here, you get a lot that you don’t get in outside schools,” said
            Heo Ye-rin, a sixth grader who commutes daily from Munsan. “When we
            go on an extracurricular trip outside, we pay none of the expenses
            because the government takes care of them.”<br /><br />
            A United States military officer, part of the American-led United
            Nations Command, which fought in the Korean War and stayed to
            enforce the armistice, gives a free English<br /><br />
            class twice a week.<br /><br />
            “We hope that when the children grow up, they will have some good
            memories of U.N.C. soldiers,” said United States Army Lt. Col. Sean
            Morrow.<br /><br />
            The troops Colonel Morrow commands are responsible for guarding the
            Joint Security Area within the DMZ, which includes Taesung and
            nearby Panmunjom, a village now uninhabited by civilians that
            straddles the border. It’s where the North Korean leader, Kim
            Jong-un, met with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea in April last
            year, and with President Trump in June this year.<br /><br />
            Such high-level diplomacy has helped ease tensions along the border.
            Today, Taesung looks like any other rural village in South Korea,
            with its golden rice paddies sparkling under the autumn sun.<br /><br />
            But “don’t let appearances fool you,” said Chun In-bum, a retired
            South Korean Army general, noting that North Korean soldiers watch
            every move of outside visitors. “It’s not your average place. It’s a
            place where all the peace is secured by dedicated soldiers.”<br /><br />
            Villagers here often find themselves front-seat witnesses to the ebb
            and flow of inter-Korean tensions.<br /><br />
            Decades ago, villagers stepped on stray mines from the war and even
            were abducted by North Korean soldiers. When the tensions were high,
            they were frequently evacuated from their fields into underground
            shelters, said Kim Dong-gu, 50, the mayor.<br /><br />
            Despite the recent thaw, villagers still conduct an evacuation drill
            twice a year. North Korea’s propaganda broadcasts, once a daily
            nuisance here, finally faded last year when both Koreas agreed to
            switch off their loudspeakers on the border.<br /><br />
            “Despite political leaders talking about easing tensions, we still
            live with them as the militaries face off with each other,” said Kim
            Yong-sung, 49, a village bean farmer.<br /><br />
            When the two Korean leaders met at Panmunjom, two Taesung Elementary
            students greeted Mr. Kim with flowers.<br /><br />
            ”I was scared but also curious about the North Korean dictator,”
            said Sin Jae-hyeok, one of the students. “After meeting him, I think
            his image in my mind has improved just a bit.”<br /><br />

          Can Artists Exploring the Korean DMZ Critically Engage with its Thorny
          History?

            A barren strip of land, four km wide and 250 km long, reinforced on
            either side by stations of troops, delineates the northern and
            southern parts of Korea. A relic from Korea’s Civil War in the
            1950s, dubbed a ‘demilitarized zone’ (DMZ), the area is widely
            considered a vacuum between the split nations, a wilderness imposed
            to maintain the 1953 Armistice Agreement. At once disarmed and
            enclosed within a heavily armed membrane, it is both immune to
            warfare and pregnant with it, arguably forming one of the world’s
            most heavily militarized areas.<br /><br />
            Yet with the anticipation of war comes its antithesis: the prospect
            of peace. Within and around the zone are peace villages, the most
            notable among them being P’anmunjŏm – characterized by its
            utilitarian 1960s architecture executed with Wes Anderson-esque
            precision – which played host to Donald Trump’s recent meeting with
            Kim Jong-un. Meanwhile, in Cheorwon County, once the centre of the
            formerly united Korean Peninsula, are the headquarters for The Real
            DMZ Project, a research-led initiative founded in 2011. Working with
            artists and academics, it has, through a series of projects,
            residencies and international exhibitions, opened up ways of
            critically engaging with the area.<br /><br />
            Inviting artists to respond to an area renowned for its ‘security
            tourism’ – an industry that relishes the sight of surveillance
            architecture – the Real DMZ Project is utopian and reparative in its
            approach, seeking to channel a vision of effective demilitarization
            and peace. Its current exhibition, ‘Negotiating Borders’, at
            London’s Korean Cultural Centre, evokes such wistful idealism. A
            cabinet of sketches pays homage to an exhibition curated by Kyong
            Park and Cathleen Crabb at the Storefront for Art and Architecture,
            New York, 1988, which was developed in response to South Korea’s
            democratic uprising of 1987. Mo Bahc’s drawing of an amulet
            re-envisions the DMZ area as unified, while Nam June Paik’s text on
            gridded paper repurposes it as a lush tiger farm, appealing to
            Japanese tourists and threatening to invaders. Nostalgia is denied
            in Seung H-Sang’s Bird’s Monastery (2017), and Lee Bul’s Study for
            Aubade (2019), which take up the mantle and recalibrate the area.
            For Seung, the zone could be used for a monastery, equipped with
            chapel, library and a roof configured as an aviary. Meanwhile, Lee
            suggests melting the barbed wire from the guard posts that enclose
            the zone to create a quasi-constructivist tower. But they are still
            feeding into a fantasy, one which quickly disintegrates in the face
            of realities depicted by other artists.<br /><br />
            The popular imagination often holds North Korea as a hermetic state
            with which any contact is untenable. While avoiding idealism, Seung
            Woo Back’s wall of photographs taken in Pyongyang, Blow up
            (2005–07), makes a start at undoing this stereotype, revealing a
            higher degree of mobility, autonomy and access than is
            conventionally associated. Back isolates and zooms in on details
            from his images to show and enlarge the nation’s humanity. A man
            slumps, a woman runs across the pavement, a child makes an ethereal
            smile, as if subtly to hint at the roles they play in the country’s
            masquerade. Collectively, these figures mark a space for
            individuality in a totalitarian state. A similar conjecture is
            apparent in Noh Suntag’s scenes from North Korea’s Arirang Mass
            Games, an annual gymnastics and arts festival staged in homage to
            Kim Jong-il and his father, the late Communist leader Kim Il Sung.
            Unlike Andreas Gursky’s polished photographs of the same subject,
            which revel in uniformity and obscure characterization, Suntang
            looks for the individuals who make up the crowd, showing the
            glitches in this synchronized operation.<br /><br />
            Other works in the show address the idea of individualism, though
            their effects are questionable. Heinkuhn OH captures soldiers on the
            DMZ in stylized, homoerotic poses; while Soyoung Chung renders a
            watch-post in sheets of fine plastic netting replete with peep holes
            – a flimsy camouflage. These works excite voyeurism but could be
            seen to ridicule or condescend to their subjects. Without a sister
            iteration in North Korea, The Real DMZ Project runs the risk of
            creating a progressive silo, reinforcing divisions rather than
            alleviating them. As curator Sunjung Kim told me, ‘It is not large,
            nor popular. But slowly, some local people and visitors have
            discovered the importance of the Real DMZ Project.’</span

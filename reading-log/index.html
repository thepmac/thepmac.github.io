                    <li>I think I'm in agreement with the notions here that we should do less bad stuff with graphic design. Unfortunately, the author doesn't offer much in terms of what concrete good we should be doing. I don’t think design is powerless
                        in terms of doing good, but I don’t think the answers are within the world of Design Thinking, which is one example of assuming too much of graphic design... or maybe it’s less a matter of scale/magnitude and more one of direction?
                        Design Thinking is a misdirection? Poor world-building? [2022.01.19]</li>

                    <li>I’m glad I read this, especially given my evangelical upbringing. I feel Wilner is very evenhanded in how he represents SIL, Townsend, et al. I remember coming across Wilner’s Are.na channel a couple years back: <a href="https://www.are.na/bryce-wilner/sil-international"
                            target="_blank">SIL International</a>. I didn’t realize it was going to culminate into this essay.</li>

                    <li>Tong sent this to me. I first sent him a photo of <a href="https://pochepublishing.com/products/poche-vol-1-an-east-village-apartment" target="_blank"><i>Poché Vol. 1</i></a>, which I saw at The Strand today, in light of our conversation
                        last last Saturday on the way to buy some things at the grocery store by Utica Ave, near his and Zhuoye’s apartment. Or, did he mention poché on the way back? Anyway, on that day, he referred to this OMA project to me.</li>

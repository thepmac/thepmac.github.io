                <ul>
                    <li>I’m glad I read this, especially given my evangelical upbringing. I feel Wilner is very evenhanded in how he represents SIL, Townsend, et al. I remember coming across Wilner’s Are.na channel a couple years back: <a href="https://www.are.na/bryce-wilner/sil-international"
                            target="_blank">SIL International</a>. I didn't realize it was going to culminate into this essay.</li>

                    <li>Tong sent this to me. I first sent him a photo of <a href="https://pochepublishing.com/products/poche-vol-1-an-east-village-apartment" target="_blank"><i>Poché Vol. 1</i></a>, which I saw at The Strand today, in light of our conversation
                        last last Saturday on the way to buy some things at the grocery store by Utica Ave, near his and Zhuoye’s apartment. Or, did he mention poché on the way back? Anyway, on that day, he referred to this OMA project to me.</li>

                    <li>Cecilia sent this after I asked what mechanicals are when she sent an image to our group chat, calling it a mechanical. She stumbled upon the image on Are.na, and it was her first mechanical she put together at FSG.</li>

			<p>Wide Rainbow is a contemporary art after school program. We are a free 501c3 non-profit based in NYC that connects contemporary artists with the community. We serve low-income neighborhoods with limited or no access to the arts or arts education.</p>
			<p>Wide Rainbow Connects is our educational video workshop series for do-it-yourself (DIY) art activities at home or in the classroom. Meet artists in their studios and recreate artworks inspired by their unique practice.  Each week we will explore a new medium and connect with a new Wide Rainbow artist. Let’s make art with artists!</p>
			<p>Let’s visit with artists (and sisters) Emma & Charlotte Kohlmann at their home in Massachusetts for a whimsical DIY workshop creating colorful creatures, puppets & a stage to let our imaginations run wild!</p>
			<p>Wide Rainbow Lessons are our free art history workshops and lesson plans. A weekly ongoing series of inspiring art activities made with everyday household materials created in collaboration with teaching artist Robin Cameron. An accessible approach to arts education that can be recreated in the classroom or at home.</p>
			<p>We collaborate with museums, galleries, and alternative art spaces providing free access to exhibtions through artist & curator-led tours.</p>

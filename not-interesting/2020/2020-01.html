              I like how the song sort of grows throughout it's duration. It's a
              song that asks you to be patient and intentionally listen. Not
              intended to be background music, I think.<br /><br />
              If this song were a stroll in the park or a city, it would start
              in some area of shade and transition to a view of a bright but not
              extremely colorful sunset. Then the stroll would twist around some
              street corners to a cozy block of nightlife. People sipping on
              wine outdoors in weather that's just getting brisk but not too
              much to keep people indoors. From shadow to an encouraging warmth
              to a happy evening. Maybe I'm thinking this because of the album
              cover, haha.

              Nothing interesting about this. There will likely never be
              anything interesting on here. Don't come back.

                Nevermind, I think I do. It's called "irony" right?

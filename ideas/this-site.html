			Make sure to figure out Adobe Illustrator SVG export for websites. <a href="http://www.veryinteractive.net" target="_blank">Very Interactive</a> uses these.

			What if my site were an online estate/property/building/land/city? A webpage is an object in a room in a building on a street in a block in a neighborhood in a burrough in a city.

			Hypertext has potential to improve on paper for certain ends. PDFs are digital mimicries of paper. They're helpful but they don't do what hypertext has the potential to do. If I were to create a website in the "shape of" a city, would a map-like navigation system be really utilizing the potential behind hypertext? Maybe bringing the user into the city of my website is a good idea, but I can think of different ways of navigating than walking around. Maybe I can have the user teleport around through a minimap. Maybe I can give users the options to walk around and explore "on foot" and open the map to jump around (like hypertext allows for).

			Consider <a href="http://xanadu.com/xUniverse-D6" target="_blank">Xanadu</a> for ideas regarding using the potential of the hypertext document.
		</p>
		<p>
			Besides styling hyperlinks, how can I design my website in a way that considers the hypertext document? Is it too brash to visualize it? I could put each hyper link in a box and draw a line to a screenshot of the document it's linked to on the side. This turns documents into visual symbols that can be recognized with repeated use. This would be similar to the original methods of visualizing hypertexts that Ted Nelson (& co?) developed.

			If my site is a city and it is some kind of world of my own extending out of my mind and what I am able to find in my consciousness and I am constantly changing and growing and deteriorating, then my city-site should always be under construction. Streets are constantly being repaired, buildings too. New streets are being laid. Old streets and buildings are being demolished. Some neighborhoods are growing, others dying.

	<p>Make sure to figure out Adobe Illustrator SVG export for websites. <a href="www.veryinteractive.net">Very Interactive</a> uses these.</p>
	<p>What if my site were an online estate/property/building/land/city? A webpage is an object in a room in a building on a street in a block in a neighborhood in a burrough in a city.</p>
	<p>Hypertext has potential to improve on paper for certain ends. PDFs are digital mimicries of paper. They're helpful but they don't do what hypertext has the potential to do. If I were to create a website in the "shape of" a city, would a map-like navigation system be really utilizing the potential behind hypertext? Maybe bringing the user into the city of my website is a good idea, but I can think of different ways of navigating than walking around. Maybe I can have the user teleport around through a minimap. Maybe I can give users the options to walk around and explore "on foot" and open the map to jump around (like hypertext allows for).</p>

	<h2>The Christian Ministry of Graphic Design</h2><br>
	<p>What would a Christian Ministry of Graphic Design look like? Who would be allowed to take part? Would it be called the CMGD? Or how about the Christian Ministry of Communication Design (CMCD)? Or just the Christian Ministry of Design (CMD)? For now, I will go with the Christian Ministry of Graphic Design.</p>
	<p>The Ministry would be a sort of coalition that cares about design because they believe God cares about design and intends that the Church do design well. They would be qualified, not just passionate dilettantes. They should be either experienced or show strong academic standing.</p>
	<p>The Ministry would need to have a strong Philosophy of Design. It would also need a strong Theology of Design. This would be a very academically led group which keeps the Church accountable and gives the Church help and direction. It's job (even all the thinking and writing and talking) is to promote and ensure that good design is made.</p>
